## Understanding the Results

### Price Range
The system shows a range (e.g., â‚¹32.50 - â‚¹38.50). This means:
- **Lower bound**: Conservative estimate
- **Predicted price**: Most likely price
- **Upper bound**: Optimistic estimate

### Model Accuracy (MAE)
Mean Absolute Error shows typical prediction variance:
- MAE of â‚¹3.00 means predictions are typically within Â±â‚¹3 of actual prices
- Lower MAE = more accurate predictions

### RÂ² Score
Shows overall model accuracy:
- 0.9394 (93.94%) means the model explains 93.94% of price variation
- Higher is better (maximum is 1.0 or 100%)

## API Integration for Developers

If you're a developer integrating this system:

### Simple Python Example
```python
import requests

def get_price_prediction(product_data):
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:5000/api/predict',
        json=product_data
    )
    return response.json()

# Example usage
data = {
    "product": "Wheat",
    "quality": "Grade A",
    "quantity_kg": 100,
    # ... other parameters
}

result = get_price_prediction(data)
print(f"Price: â‚¹{result['predicted_price_per_kg']}/kg")
```

See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete API details.

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not loaded" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've run:
```bash
python3 data/generate_data.py
python3 model/train_model.py
```

### Web page not loading
**Solution**: Check if Flask app is running:
```bash
python3 run.py
```

### Prediction seems wrong
**Check**:
1. All input values are realistic
2. Demand/supply indices are accurate
3. Quality grade matches product condition
4. Transport costs are reasonable

### Connection errors
**Solution**: Make sure the server is running on port 5000 and not blocked by firewall.
